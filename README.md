# PDF Compressor & Watermark - iLovePDF

**PDF Compressor & Watermark - iLovePDF** is the official iLovePDF plugin for WordPress. It allows you to automatically compress your PDF files and add watermarks, saving storage space and enhancing your PDF's security. 

With seamless integration, you can optimize all PDFs in your Media Library and stamp them automaticallyâ€”just like you do on [iLovePDF.com](https://www.ilovepdf.com/).

### Key Features

- **Automatic Compression:** PDFs are compressed upon upload using the iLovePDF API, saving up to 50% storage space without losing quality.
- **Watermarking:** Automatically add text or image watermarks to your PDFs upon upload to safeguard your files.
- **Manual & Bulk Actions:** Compress or add watermarks to existing PDFs individually or in bulk.
- **Easy to Use:** Configure it once, and the plugin handles the rest, automating PDF optimization for future uploads.

## How It Works

### PDF Compression

- **Automatic:** Every time a PDF is uploaded, it gets compressed via iLovePDF API, reducing file size while maintaining quality. This feature can be toggled off if needed.
- **Manual:** Compress PDFs one by one or all at once from the Media Library. On average, compression can save up to 50% of the disk space.

### Watermarking PDFs

- **Automatic:** Add watermarks to PDFs upon upload. This feature can also be disabled if not required.
- **Manual:** Watermark PDFs individually or apply watermarks in bulk to existing files. You can choose between text or image watermarks.

### Bulk Actions

Easily apply compression or watermarking actions to multiple files at once, streamlining your file management process. Bulk actions can be performed on all files in the Media Library with a single click.

### Automatic Processing

Set up the plugin to apply compression and watermarking automatically for all future PDF uploads, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
